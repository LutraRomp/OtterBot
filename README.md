OtterBot
========

And Experimental IRC ChatBot

Purpose
--------

This is my experimental platform for exploring Computational Linguistic algorithms.

There aren't any planned paths that I have for this project as its more of a sandbox
for playing around.

Usage
-----

The bot currently doesn't do anything interesting.  It reuses some old code that determined
whether it was being talked to, talked about or not involved in a conversation at all.

It will always say something if there is chat room activity, but it's not doing anything
useful yet.
